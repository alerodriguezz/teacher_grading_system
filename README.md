# teacher_grading_system

This was the final project for my C++ course in my freshman year of college. It is a teacher grading system. This program will read a file that reads a student's name, id, five quiz scores, two midterm scores, and one final scores. This program and calculate the numeric average, letter grade, and ranking of each student. After that, the program should display the course result in order of numeric averages and first names respectively. This program will display results in a histogram.
